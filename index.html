        Vijay was born as Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar on 22 June 1974 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu.[15] His father, S. A.

        Initially attending Fathima Matriculation Higher Secondary School[21] at Kodambakkam, Vijay later joined the Balalok
        Matriculation Higher Secondary School[22] at Virugambakkam and went on to pursue a degree in Visual Communications from

     <div class="rpara">
        Ajith Kumar (born 1 May 1971) is an Indian actor who works predominantly in Tamil cinema. To date, he has starred in
        over 61 films, and his awards include four Vijay Awards, three Cinema Express Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and
        three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. In addition to his acting career, Ajith is also a sports car racer and participated
        in the MRF Racing series (2010). He became a race car driver, competing in circuits around India in places such as
        Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi. He is one among very few Indians to race in the International arena and in Formula
        championships. Based on the annual earnings of Indian celebrities, he was included in the Forbes India Celebrity 100
        list three times.[2]
        
        He began his career with a small role in the 1990 Tamil romantic drama En Veedu En Kanavar. He established himself as a
        romantic hero with Kadhal Kottai (1996), Aval Varuvala (1998) and Kaadhal Mannan (1998), and established himself as an
        action hero starting with the film Amarkalam (1999). Ajith's dual portrayal of twin brothers—where one is deaf-mute—in
        S. J. Suryah's Vaali (1999) won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He earned critical acclaim for his
        dual roles in the vigilante film Citizen (2001).[3] In 2006, he starred in Varalaru, in which he played three different
        roles. It became the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2006, and earned him another Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
        Tamil.[4] The following year he starred in two remakes—Kireedam (2007) and Billa (2007),[a] both of which earned him
        critical acclaim.[4] Ajith played an antihero in Mankatha (2011),[5] which became one of the highest-grossing Tamil
        films of all time.[6] His next release, Billa II (2012), was Tamil cinema's first prequel.[b]
        
        Ajith has also been abroad for various races, including Germany and Malaysia. He drove in the 2003 Formula Asia BMW
        Championships.[8] He raced in the 2010 Formula 2 Championship along with two other Indians, Armaan Ebrahim and Parthiva
        Sureshwaren.[9]

        Ajith began his acting career through a one-scene appearance as a school child in En Veedu En Kanavar (1990). Through
        the recommendation of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, whose son was a classmate of Ajith, he was cast in his first lead role in
        the Telugu romantic drama Prema Pusthakam (1993), which remains his only Telugu film to date. However, the shoot of the
        film was stalled soon after production began, following the death of the film's director Gollapudi Srinivas.[17] As a
        result, his first major theatrical release was the Tamil romantic drama Amaravathi (1993), which Ajith had signed after
        being recommended to director Selva by Balasubrahmanyam, who had seen parts of Prema Pusthakam prior to its delay.[18]
        As the film went into post-production, Ajith was bed-ridden due to a racing injury while training for an amateur motor
        race. He underwent three major surgeries resulting in bed rest for one and a half years. As a result, his voice in the
        film was dubbed by actor Vikram.[14] Following the injury, Ajith was keen to make up for lost time and signed on to play
        supporting roles. In the following years, he played character roles in the Arvind Swami-starrer Paasamalargal (1994) and
        Vijay-starrer Rajavin Parvaiyile (1995). He was also seen in the family drama Pavithra (1994), which featured him as an
        ailing patient shown maternal affection from Raadhika.[19][16]
